# Selective Amnesia on a Conditional VAE for MNIST

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook implementing the Selective Amnesia algorithm on a CVAE for the MNIST dataset. The goal is to selectively "unlearn" or "forget" specific digit classes from a pre-trained CVAE model.

It also contains a fixed.ipynb notebook where further experiments were conducted: plotting the Latent Space and Latent Traversal Grid, and exploring the effects of different LATENT_DIM and EPOCHS values on the quality of the generated outputs.

The implementation is based on the paper:
**Selective Amnesia: A Continual Learning Approach to Forgetting in Deep Generative Models**
