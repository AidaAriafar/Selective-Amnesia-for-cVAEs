# Selective Amnesia on a Conditional VAE for MNIST

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook implementing the **Selective Amnesia** algorithm on a Conditional VAE (CVAE) for the MNIST dataset. The goal is to selectively "unlearn" or "forget" specific digit classes from a pre-trained CVAE model.

The implementation is based on the paper:
**Selective Amnesia: A Continual Learning Approach to Forgetting in Deep Generative Models**
(Alvin Heng, Harold Soh - arXiv:2305.10120)

## Tasks Completed

The notebook is structured to perform three main tasks:

### Task 1: Implement Selective Amnesia
A baseline CVAE is first trained on all 10 MNIST classes. Then, the Selective Amnesia algorithm is applied to unlearn a specified set of "forget" classes. This is achieved by:
1.  **Calculating Fisher Information (FIM)** using only the "forget" classes.
2.  **Fine-tuning** the baseline model with a 3-part loss function:
    * **$\mathcal{L}_{retain}$:** Preserves the quality of the remaining classes.
    * **$\mathcal{L}_{SA}$:** The Selective Amnesia loss (subtracting the FIM penalty) to induce forgetting.
    * **$\mathcal{L}_{neg}$:** A "gray-out" loss to push the forgotten output to noise.

### Task 2: Visualize the Latent Space
To analyze the effect of unlearning, two visualization methods are implemented:
1.  **Latent Space (t-SNE) Plot:** Compares the t-SNE plot of the baseline model's latent space (showing 10 distinct clusters) to the unlearned model's space, where the "forget" clusters are shown to be scattered or dissolved.
2.  **Latent Traversal Grid:** Generates a grid of images by smoothly interpolating across the latent space to visualize the learned manifold's structure.

### Task 3: Attempt to Generate Forgotten Classes
1.  **Reconstruction Attack (z-search):** Tries to find a latent vector `z` that forces the unlearned model to reconstruct a high-quality prototype of the forgotten digit (generated by the *baseline* model).
2.  **Classifier Gradient Ascent (Input Optimization):** Trains a separate classifier and attempts to generate an image *from scratch* (starting with noise) that maximizes the classifier's confidence for the forgotten class.
